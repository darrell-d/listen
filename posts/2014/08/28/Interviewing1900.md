#Interviewing with limited experience
I've gone through a couple of cycles of co-op candidates at work. The Drexel co-op program here in Philadelphia is required for most CS majors to graduate. It's a good program! It gives students real work experience and helps them pad their resumes before the go out into the "real world"

Of course this extra padding of the resume assumes that you get a job in the first place. I go through dozens of resumes each cycle for students who are seeking employment in the development field for the first time and have found a few things happen repeatedly that make me either put your name into the "NO" pile instantly or very politely cut our interview short.

Hopefully potential first time interns / co-ops with limited experience will benefit from this.
