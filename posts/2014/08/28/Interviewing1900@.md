#Interviewing with limited experience
I've gone through a couple of cycles of co-op candidates at work. The Drexel co-op program here in Philadelphia is required for most CS majors to graduate. It's a good program! It gives students real work experience and helps them pad their resumes before the go out into the "real world"

Of course this extra padding of the resume assumes that you get a job in the first place. I go through dozens of resumes each cycle for students who are seeking employment in the development field for the first time and have found a few things happen repeatedly that make me either put your name into the "NO" pile instantly or very politely cut our interview short.

Hopefully potential first time interns / co-ops with limited experience will benefit from this.

###I don't care about the alpahbet soup, jus show me what you did
I don't care how many abbreviations you can cram onto your resume as it all ends up meaning nothing. Sometime ago I found someone who had every exciting language and technology possible on their resume. I got exicted, I wanted to interview and talk to this kid. He was also the owner of his own company. I thought: "Wow! This kid is going to shine and would be a great addition to our team! He'll hop aboard and just start getting stuff done at once."

Then I looked closer at his resume. He listed all of these technlogies but then had no details about anything he did with any of them. I looked at the website for his "company" and every line made me cring. It was like reading the greatest hits of every cringe worthy startup. The site had page after page of nothing. At the end I had no idea what the company was about, no idea what was being worked on, no idea that it was anything more than a generic template that was just filled with words.

Add a few key technologies that you worked with, but then tell me exactly what you did. Give me a quick overview of some cool, interesting or fun things you have accomplished using techology. Even if the tech stack you've worked with doesn't match what I'm looking for exactly I'll consider your resume more than the person that just lists every technology available. 

Even if you don't have much experience, just mention a small project you worked on in class, mention some of the highlights of what you did with it. In the interview we'll go over those class projects in detail to see what you understood from it.

###Don't list tools that you use to code
Visual Studio, Notepad++, Sublime, vim, XCode. What do all of these items have in common? 

They have no place on your resume.

They are tools that you use to write code and tell me nothing about you and your skill. It is space wasted that you could have used to go into detail about something that you worked on to give me a better insight into your skillset. I personally don't care what you use to write code in. I might raise an eyebrow if you use Notepad to write yoour code, but apart from that I don't really care what you write code in. If you want to use MS Word with a series of plugins to make it highlight JavaScript then be my guest. As long as your code works and is clean I won't mind.

Don't even get me started on listing Word, Excel, Chrome/ Firefox as skills. Please just stop.

###Extracurriculars are cool and fun, but don't go overboard with them

Again I get that most students looking for their first job don't have much experience but I really don't care that you planted 300 trees one summer, or that you attmpted to get a bill to pass to ban plastic bottles or that you went to bible school.

Extracurriculars are a nice extra to get to know a little bit about a student, but please keep it brief and stick and don't go overboard with listing every club you were part of since high school.

###Be honest
I know it can be rough trying to get your start. You find your self in the catch-22 where you have no experience because you don't have a job, and you don't have a job because you have no experience. This is understandable but don't lie on your resume. It will become quickly apparent in the interview if you're not as skilled as you claim or if you don't know how to use a technology. You will be quickly and polietly shown to the door in minutes after you arrive.
